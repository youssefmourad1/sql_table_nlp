## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is designed to facilitate the extraction of trading data from SQL INSERT statements into a structured CSV format. It uses a Flask-based REST API to accept SQL files, processes them to find relevant trading commands and parameters, and outputs the results in an easy-to-use CSV file.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
Python 3
pip
Flask
Pandas
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-file-processor-api.git
cd sql-file-processor-api
```

Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the server:
```
python app.py
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. For now, tests can be manual:

### Break down into end to end tests

Test the entire system by uploading a test SQL file through your chosen API client (e.g., Postman or curl).

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@path_to_your_test_file.sql" http://localhost:5000/process_sql
```

### And coding style tests

Ensure your code adheres to PEP8 standards:

```bash
flake8
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

After starting the server, use the following endpoint to process SQL files:

- **POST /process_sql**: Upload an SQL file to be processed. Returns the path to the output CSV.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

For deployment on a live system, consider using Gunicorn as the WSGI server with Nginx as the reverse proxy. Refer to the deployment section above for details on setting this up on a server.
